The Effectiveness of State Anti-Discrimination Laws 
for Same Sex Applicants in the Home Mortgage Market

======================

Abstract: Although recent court decisions have increased the number of states with marriage equality, state legislatures retain power over who is protected from discrimination when seeking housing. 21 states and Washington D.C. have anti-discrimination laws in place which are meant to prevent unfair treatment for same sex couples. Using hundreds of thousands of mortgage applications from 2007 to 2013 in Washington D.C., St. Louis, Delaware, and Indiana this study shows that same sex applicants do receive loans at an origination rate lower than opposite sex applicants. State and local anti-discrimination laws do result in less disparity between the sets of applicants, but inequality persists.
